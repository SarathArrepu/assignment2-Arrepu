###### City - venice/ Country - Iceland


 Venice, known also as the “City of Canals,” “The Floating City,” and “Serenissima,” is arguably one of **Italy’s most picturesque cities. With its winding canals, striking architecture, and beautiful bridges**, Venice is a popular destination for travel.

 Iceland, island country located in the North Atlantic Ocean. Lying on the constantly active geologic border between North America and Europe, **Iceland is a land of vivid contrasts of climate, geography, and culture**. Sparkling glaciers, such as Vatna Glacier (Vatnajökull), Europe’s largest, lie across its ruggedly beautiful mountain ranges; abundant hot geysers provide heat for many of the country’s homes and buildings and allow for hothouse agriculture year-round; and the offshore Gulf Stream provides a surprisingly mild climate for what is one of the northernmost inhabited places on the planet.
